# Before any bot project

There are several places you need to visit for starting work with any Telegram Bot framework on any language:

* [Bots info introduction](https://core.telegram.org/bots)
* [Telegram Bot API reference](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) (you can skip it, but it could be useful to know some specific cases in Telegram Bot API)

Anyway, the most important link is [How do I create a bot?](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot) inside of Telegram Bot API

## Next steps

* [Including in your project](including-in-your-project.html)
