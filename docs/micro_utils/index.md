# MicroUtils

`MicroUtils` is a set of libraries to help me (and, I hope, you too) in some routine doings of coding.

First of all, this library collection is oriented to use next technologies:

* [`Kotlin Coroutines`](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines)
* [`Kotlin Serialization`](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization)
* [`Kotlin Exposed`](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed)
* [`Ktor`](https://ktor.io)
* [`Koin`](https://insert-koin.io)
* [`Korlibs`](https://docs.korge.org)

> WARNING:
> 
> Due to complexity of this library, it is possible that some things will be missed or inactual.
> Me and the users of this library will try hard to keep its docs as actual as possible, but in case
> you will find some inconsistency of docs and library work (signatures, behaviour, API) you may write
> me directly in my [telegram](https://t.me/InsanusMokrassar)
